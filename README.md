# Cplusplus-Samples
•	AI.h – In my freshman year of college, I got a team together to work throughout the semester to create a C++ project. We chose to create the popular "Battleship" game. My contribution to the project was creating a computer AI for a player to compete against. The code for the AI is below.

•	Assignment1.cpp - This was an assignment for my Programming Fundamentals 2 class. The assignment was to write a  C++ program that creates three (3) different N*N magic squares. A square matrix is the arrangement of the numbers 1, 2, , , in which the sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are the same. The users will specify the size of the square matrix: N. The value N must be an odd number between 3 and 15.

•	Construct.cpp - In this assignment from my data structures and algorithms class, I reconstruct a tree using its postorder and inorder traversals, and print its levelorder for the output.

•	Hint.cpp - This is code I wrote for a project for my data structures and algorithms class.
There are two parts to this project.
First part: find the number of occurrences of a "hint" string in each row and column of a character matrix and form two strings that contain
the number of times the "hint" string is found in each row and column. For example, with a 3x3 matrix, if the hint string was only found once
between the characters of the first row, three times among the characters of the third row, and once among the characters of the second column, the two
strings produced would be "103" and "010".
Second part: find the longest common subsequence of the two strings produced in the first part. This was done using dynamic programming.

•	MIPSsim.java - This is a project I wrote for my Computer Organization class. It converts custom 32-bit string of binary integer instructions (given as an input file) to corresponding MIPS instructions and executes the instructions and writes out to two files, one containing the contents of the execution, and one containing the disassembled instructions from the 32-bit string of binary integers. This is written in java.
